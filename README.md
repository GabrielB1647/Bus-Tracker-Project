# Bus-Tracker-Project

In this exercise, using a CSS grid, which allows you to set a target-specific area for styling.  In this example, I used a Bus tracker layout of the Boston area.

Road Map of Future Improvements: In future work on this project, I want to add different areas, types, and maps.  One specific idea I want to play with is using this concept to locate gas stations in a specific target area. 

## How to Run: 
- Launch Index.html
- Select Show stops Between MIT and Harvard button
- Watch the map tracker shows the various stops.
